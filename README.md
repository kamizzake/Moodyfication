💡 Project Idea
**Moodyfication** is an AI-enhanced web application that recommends personalized music playlists based on a user’s current mood or emotions.  
Users can input their feelings (happy, stressed, relaxed) through text or selective emojis, and then the app will analyze the users mood to suggest suitable songs and playlists using the Spotify API and simple sentiment analysis.  

Our goal is to create a **mood-driven music experience** that connects technology with emotion — helping users express, understand, and regulate their feelings through music.
